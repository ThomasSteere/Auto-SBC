## EAFC Automated SBC Solving ⚽

#### The goal is to automatically solve the SBC using the currently available players in the club with the minimum cost.

### Frontend
The project utilizes [tamper monkey script](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) to output the users Club Player Data.
Install the tampermonkey extension and then install [the frontend script](https://github.com/ThomasSteere/Auto-SBC/raw/main/tampermonkey-ai-sbc.user.js)

This script implements a number of backend functions but the main feature is a Solve SBC button on each SBC that send players to the backend solver. The solver will attempt to use the current sbc solution as a starting point. This means subsequent solves ( pushing solve sbc button ) will use the previous solve as a starting point.

Players will also get SBC Lock button to not send use this player in the solution (if its a duplicate it will get sent)

Also a set the cost of this player to 0 button so it will get most likely get used if it can be fit into the SBC.
This is useful to get rid of high rated duplicates or overpriced SBCS.

Check out the settings menu item for extra details!

### Backend

Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies.
To run the backend, simply run `python -m uvicorn main:app --reload` after installing python and the required dependencies.
- [Google OR-Tools v9.8](https://github.com/google/or-tools)
- Python 3.9
- pandas
- openpyxl
- fastapi
- uvicorn

The constraints used in the program are created in the `optimize.py` file based of the SBC requirements and the optimization problem is solved using [Google CP-SAT solver](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/cp_solver).

### Shoutouts
Thanks to [Regista6](https://github.com/Regista6) for showing the way with the google OR tools
